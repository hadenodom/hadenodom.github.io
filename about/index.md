## About Me

Hi!  I'm Haden Odom.  I hail from a small town in Mississippi, where I spent the first decade and a half of my life without a computer, before eventually getting a little 686 machine and dial-up. Technology fascinated me then. And it still fascinates me now.

I currently work in an IT advisory/analyst role, while attending classes at WGU, working towards a Bachelorâ€™s of Science in Software Development.  

I have an endless fascination with discovering how things work, and how complex systems operate.  That's what drew me to programming, and that's what also draws me to the realm of policy.  When I finish my Bachelor's degree this year, I hope to pursue a Master's in Public Policy (MPP).  

I'm a member of the Mississippi Libertarian Party, and I'm currently working on organizing Libertarians in my small town, to have an impact on local politics.  Among issues I care deeply about, the following are of the utmost importance to me:

* Reducing the tax burden imposed on individuals
* Eliminating Subsidies (and helping people understand how harmful and ineffective subsidies are)
* Getting rid of our Federal Student Loan system, which not only incentives lenders to grant predatory loans, but backs them with Federal insurance
* The elimination of victimless crimes (i.e. making sure you can smoke plants and collect rainwater without fear of a tyrannical government impeding your actions)
* Helping shape a national and local political environment that's focused more on individual rights than on collectivism and culture wars

I hope to regularly publish articles on this site that provide insight into the policy challenges facing our society, and that help shape the public debate in a constructive way.

## About Me

Hi!  I'm Haden Odom.  I hail from a small town in Mississippi, where I spent the first decade and a half of my life without a computer, before eventually getting a little 686 machine and dial-up.  Technology fascinated me then.  And it still fascinates me now.  

I currently work in an IT advisory/analyst role, while attending classes at WGU, working towards a Bachelor's of Science in Software Development.  

I generally do well with any programming language.  I have an endless fascination with and curiosity about how things work, and how they can work better.  I like to understand a system from the top to the bottom.  

I have a few very basic philosophies about the things I work on:

* Make things portable
* Keep things simple
* Focus on the problem you're solving and stay within scope
* Document every thought you have when writing code


When I'm not in front of a computer, I'm usually:

* Cooking or baking
* Running or in the gym
* Meditating
* Playing guitar
